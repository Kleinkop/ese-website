#### Where are the sights?
Many sights such as the Frauenkirche, Zwinger, Fürstenzug and Residenzschloss can be found in the Old Town, Dresden's historic centre.

The quarter on the other side of the Elbe is called Neustadt with the Golden Horseman, the Japanese Palace, the Pfunds Dairy and the Kunsthof Passage (Art Courtyard Passage).

Not far from the campus there is the Großer Garten park with the Dresden Zoo. But also the Blue Wonder and the Dresden railways in Loschwitz are worth a visit or a ride.

For further sightseeing and more detailed information, please refer to the [website of the city of Dresden](https://www.dresden.de/en/tourism/attractions/sights.php){:target="_blank"}.

#### What is the Neustadt?
The Neustadt north of the Elbe is considered the Bohemian Quarter of Dresden. Its original flair results from the many small shops, pubs, bars and restaurants along the narrow streets and colourful lanes. A true dream for every student ;). Every year, the district party *Bunte Republik Neustadt (BRN)* and the many sights attract thousands of visitors. A visit is definitely worthwhile!

#### Where can I go to the cinemas, theatres...?
In the city centre is the *Rundkino* cinema and the *UFA Kristallpalast* cinema. In summer the film nights take place on the banks of the Elbe. The *Kino im Kasten* cinema has student prices and is visited by us during the ESE.

Theatre fans can enjoy a wide range of programmes, for example of the *Staatsschauspiel Dresden* or the *Comödie Dresden*. Musical highlights are the *Dixieland-Festival* and the *Dresden Music Festival*.

#### Where can you relax and recover?
If the meadow at the pond behind the faculty is no longer sufficient, we recommend a visit to the Großer Garten park or the Elbe meadows on the Königsufer with its beautiful view of the old town.

You can also use your free time more actively by taking a walk in the forests of the Dresdner Heide or a bicycle tour along the Elbe.

#### Are there student clubs?
Of course, and in Dresden there are 14 of them. You can find an overview on the [page of the Studentenwerk](https://www.studentenwerk-dresden.de/kultur/studentenclubs.html){:target="_blank"}.

Every year in May the [Dresden night hike](https://www.dresdner-nachtwanderung.de/){:target="_blank"} takes place. There is live music, free drinks and shuttle buses between all the clubs.

#### How do I get from A to B?
With your student ID card, you can use a large part of the local public transport in the VVO free of charge. It is also valid as a [semester ticket](https://www.vvo-online.de/en/tariff-tickets/special-tickets/semestertickets-153.cshtml){:target="_blank"} for regional transport in Saxony.

Many routes in Dresden can also be easily done with your own bike or one of the many [nextbike/sz-bike rental bikes](https://www.stura.tu-dresden.de/nextbike#General){:target="_blank"}. You will find them at many crossroads all over Dresden and extra stations on campus.
