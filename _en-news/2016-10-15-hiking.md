Dresden isn't known only for the old town but as well for the beautiful hiking paradise, the SÃ¤chsische Schweiz. We'll meet on Saturday, the 15th of October, at the train station "Dresden Hauptbahnhof", platform 18, and we'll take the train S1 in the direction of Krippen at 8:29. Don't forget your student ID, it is your train ticket! It'll take us approximately five hours excluding breaks, so don't forget enough food for the day. We'll go back from Schmilka with the ferry and train.
